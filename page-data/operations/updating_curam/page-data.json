Assuming that all images are tagged with the same tag, the upgrade command would look like the following example:\n\n```bash\nhelm upgrade <releasename> <chartName> --reuse-values --set images.tag=vNext\n```\n\nThe above command keeps all the values used with the original `helm install` due to the `--reuse-values` flag, and only changes the `images.tag` value, so all new images are deployed with the `vNext` tag.\n\nLike `kubectl`, if you must reverse any configuration changes applied by the last action, use `helm rollback <releasename>`.\n\nThe full documentation of the `helm upgrade` command is available on the Helm [Updating a Deployment](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_upgrade/) page.\n\n## Upgrade with SQL changes\n\nBoth of the scenarios above assume a no-impact, zero-downtime upgrade, that is no changes to the database are required.\nHowever, should the rollout include schema changes, the application must be halted.
