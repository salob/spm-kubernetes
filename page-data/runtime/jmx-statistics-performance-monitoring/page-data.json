The advantage of this mechanism is that it can be used for collecting statistics from every server in an environment\n\nThe primary properties used to configure timer-based statistics are integrated into the Helm Charts.\n\nA prerequisite for using timer-based SPM JMX statistics is to override `global.apps.common.persistence.enabled=true`.\n\nYou must also consider the other persistence-related settings and configure them appropriately.\n\n### Cúram JMX statistics persisteance\n\nPersistence is required for timer-based statistics because of the non-permanent nature of pods means that as they come and go, you might need statistics from an earlier execution.\n\nEnable timer-based JMX statistics with a `global.apps.common.persistence.jmxstats.enabled=true` override.\nOnce configured, the following SPM properties are added to the Liberty pod jvm.options files with the defaults shown:\n\n```shell\n-Dcuram.jmx.output_statistics_timer_enabled=true\n-Dcuram.jmx.output_statistics_timer_folder=/tmp/jmx/\n-Dcuram.jmx.output_statistics_timer_period=60000\n```\n\nYou can override the value of the timer period by using `global.apps.common.persistence.jmxstats.timerPeriod` where the value is specified as the\nnumber of milliseconds between each timer. For example, 60000 = 1 minute.\n\nInside the specified timer folder are the statistics XML files, named with a datetimestamp and pod name.\n\n__For example:__`202009171025363411@bugsbunny-apps-curam-producer-6c9bf7dc46-snw4w-1661122509.xml`\n\n## Considerations\n\n* The default of `1 minute` for the timer period might be too short because over an extended time, depending upon the amount of application activity, the persistent storage could be exhausted.\n  * Consider also the length of time a pod will run; if the timer period is too short, data since the last timer period is lost.\n* No timer-based statistics are generated until the first login or JMS message is processed.\n* Turn off statistics for running pods by editing the configmaps where `-Dcuram.jmx.output_statistics_timer_enabled=true` is set, changing the value to false, and restarting the pods.\nFor example:\n  * Use the `kubectl get configmaps` command to list all the configmaps.\n  * The configmaps you need to change are those named with `*-jvm-override-*` and the number and names of the configmaps vary depending on your configuration.\n  * For each configmap, use the `kubectl edit configmap` command to change the `curam.jmx.output_statistics_timer_enabled` setting to false.\n  * Use the `kubectl delete pod` command for each of the application producer and consumer pods that have a corresponding application name to the configmap.\n  * On restart the new pod no longer generates statistics files.\n* By default, statistics are accumulated over the life of a pod; therefore, the last file generated is superset of all the other files for that pod, therefore and you should only need the latest file.\n  * There is a property to change this behavior so each period resets the statistics, but then you would have to address how to amalgamate the data and make sense of it; so,changing this is not recommended.\n* In support of EJB timers, IBM WebSphere Liberty dynamically creates three tables each time a pod starts; a `PART`, `PROP`, and `TASK` table.\n  * The amount of data in these tables is small; but, over time could result in a large number of these tables in your database.\n  * You should monitor these tables and drop those for pods that no longer exist.\n  * These tables are prefixed with `EJBTIMER_`, followed by the pod name.
