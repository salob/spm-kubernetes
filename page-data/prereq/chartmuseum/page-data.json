For more information, see [Preparing Helm Charts](/deployment/hc_preparation).\n\n## Configure Helm to access the local repository\n\nTo use ChartMuseum as a repository, you must configure Helm to point to it. Run the following command:\n\n```shell\nhelm repo add local-development http://127.0.0.1:8080/\n```\n\nVerify the list of repositories by running the following command:\n\n```shell\nhelm repo list\n```\n\nThe helm repo list command also returns the `local-development` repository that you added when you ran the `helm repo add` command.\n\nWhen the repository is added, run the following command to refresh the Helm index:\n\n```shell\nhelm repo update\n```\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"08f33eaebee4eb8ea27c818e02a5a8f9","counter":151,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"ChartMuseum","description":"ChartMuseum"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: ChartMuseum\ndescription: ChartMuseum\n---\n\nHelm charts are stored in a repository.
