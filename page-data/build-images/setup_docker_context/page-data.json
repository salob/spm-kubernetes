To create a `release-stage` folder to contain the contents of `release.zip`, run the following command:\n\n  ```shell\n  mkdir $SPM_HOME/dockerfiles/Liberty/content/release-stage\n  ```\n\n1. To extract `release.zip` into the `release-stage` folder, run the following commands:\n\n  ```shell\n  unzip -qd $SPM_HOME/dockerfiles/Liberty/content/release-stage /tmp/release.zip\n  chmod +x $SPM_HOME/dockerfiles/Liberty/content/release-stage/*.sh\n  ```\n\n  Where `/tmp/release.zip` is the absolute path where the `release.zip` is saved.\n\n## Modifying SPM properties\n\n`Bootstrap.properties` and `AppServer.properties` are required to configure WebSphere® Liberty.\nHowever the relevant properties in `Bootstrap.properties` that you modify in the on-premise implementation of SPM are no longer relevant because Kubernetes configmaps provide the necessary values for the database configuration.\n\nThe only properties that you must modify in `AppServer.properties` are `security.username` and `security.password`.\nThese properties contain the WebSphere Liberty administrator credentials. If the password is changed, the value must be the encrypted  by running the following commands:\n\n```shell\ncd $SERVER_DIR\n./build.sh encrypt -Dpassword=<The password to be encrypted>\n```\n\nCopy the property files by using the following command:\n\n```shell\ncd $SPM_HOME/dockerfiles/Liberty/content\ncp -vf *.properties release-stage/project/properties/\n```\n\n## WebSphere Liberty server configuration\n\nAll configuration of WebSphere Liberty will be handled by the Helm Charts. See the [Preparing Helm Charts](/deployment/hc_preparation) topic for more information.\n\n## Copying static content artifacts\n\nCopy the static content `.zip` file for Docker image creation. Run the following command:\n\n```shell\ncp -vf /tmp/StaticContent.zip $SPM_HOME/dockerfiles/HTTPServer/\n```\n\n## Installing external artifacts\n\nIn addition to `release.zip` and `StaticContent.zip`, download and install the following artifacts.\n\n### Add the Ant zip file to the Docker environment\n\nCopy `apache-ant-1.10.6-bin.zip` to `$SPM_HOME/dockerfiles/Liberty/content`. If Ant is not already available on the computer, run the following commands:\n\n```shell\ncd $SPM_HOME/dockerfiles/Liberty/content\nwget https://archive.apache.org/dist/ant/binaries/apache-ant-1.10.6-bin.zip\n```\n\n### CryptoConfig.jar\n\n`CryptoConfig.jar` is required for SPM cryptography to function correctly. This jar is automatically created in the following locations when you run the\n `build.sh configtest` target:\n\n* `$SERVER_DIR/build/CryptoConfig.jar`\n* `$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext/CryptoConfig.jar`\n\nHowever, the `release.zip` does not include this jar file, so the jar file must be copied separately from the environment where the `release.zip` was built.\n\nPlace the `CryptoConfig.jar` file in `$SPM_HOME/dockerfiles/Liberty/content/release-stage/build`.\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\nCryptography keystores for SPM vary based on the JVM vendor, so the vendor in the build environment must correspond to that used in the Docker images.\nThe `websphere-liberty` images from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/websphere-liberty) use IBM Java SDK 8.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\nFor convenience, you can use the following command to create a `CryptoConfig.jar` file in a Docker container:\n\n```shell\ndocker run --rm \\\n    -v $ANT_HOME:/tmp/ant \\\n    -v $SPM_HOME/dockerfiles/Liberty/content/release-stage:/work/dir \\\n    -v $SPM_HOME/dockerfiles/Liberty/content/release-stage/SetEnvironment.sh:/work/SetEnvironment.sh \\\n    -w /work/dir \\\n    -u root \\\n    -e ANT_HOME=/tmp/ant \\\n    -e WLP_HOME=/opt/ibm/wlp \\\n    websphere-liberty:20.0.0.9-full-java8-ibmjava \\\n    bash -c 'export PATH=$ANT_HOME/bin:$PATH:.; build.sh internal.update.crypto.jar'\n```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\nNote the use of `$ANT_HOME` above. The value must map to a working copy of Ant on your workstation, which can be extracted from `$SPM_HOME/dockerfiles/Liberty/content/apache-ant-1.10.6-bin.zip`:\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n```shell\n# Ignore this step if ANT_HOME is already set.\nunzip -qd /tmp/ $SPM_HOME/dockerfiles/Liberty/content/apache-ant-1.10.6-bin.zip\nexport ANT_HOME=/tmp/apache-ant-1.10.6\n```\n\n### Installing javax.mail.jar and activation.jar files\n\nJava Mail is an external dependency for SPM and is represented by the JAR files `activation.jar` and `javax.mail.jar`.\nPlace these files in the folder `$SPM_HOME/dockerfiles/Liberty/content/dependencies` (filenames must be exact, that is, have no version numbers).\n\nIf you do not have the jar files available, you can use the `getJavaMail.xml` Ant file that is located in the `$SPM_HOME/dockerfiles/Liberty/content` folder to download the files:\n\n```shell\ncd $SPM_HOME/dockerfiles/Liberty/content\n$ANT_HOME/bin/ant -f getJavaMail.xml\n```\n\nConfirm the availability of the JAR files by running the following command:\n\n`ls $SPM_HOME/dockerfiles/Liberty/content/dependencies`\n\n### Downloading IBM MQ Resource Adapter\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** As of Release 20.7.0, the IBM MQ Resource Adapter version used to verify this runbook is 9.1.5.0.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\nIBM MQ is required for WebSphere Liberty JMS support, therefore you must install the MQ Resource Adapter.\n\n1. Download the IBM MQ resource adapter from Fix Central.\n    * Click this link: [IBM MQ Resource Adapter](https://ibm.biz/mq91cdRA)\n    * Find the resource adapter for your version of IBM MQ in the displayed list of available fixes.
